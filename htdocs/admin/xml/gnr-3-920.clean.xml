  <text>Prior to the acquisition, construction, leasing or installation of a project or the material extension of an existing project, the Authority shall deliver or mail by certified mail a notice of its intention to undertake such project or extension of a project to the chief executive officer of the county in which such project is or is to be located and to the secretary or clerk of the board of county commissioners or the legislative body of such county (as the case may be). The Authority shall not acquire, construct, lease, or install a project or materially extend any existing project if the board of county commissioners, the city council, or the county council (as the case may be) of the county in which such project is or is to be located advises the Authority, within 120 days following the date of the notice required in this section, that it has found that, after a public hearing which has been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected county at least 14 days prior to such hearing and after considering the recommendations of the chief executive officer of the county and such other facts as it deemed relevant and material, such acquisition, construction, leasing, installation, or extension would be contrary to the best interests of the residents of such county because it would be contrary to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of such county by reason of (i) the impact of such project on the environment, or (ii) a conflict of such project with the master plan of the county, or (iii) such other facts concerning such project or effects of such project as such legislative body shall find would have an adverse effect on such health, safety and welfare.</text>
