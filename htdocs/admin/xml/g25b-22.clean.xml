  <text>Under the provisions of &#xA7; 8 of Article XI-F of the Constitution of Maryland the General Assembly has exclusive power, by local law, to limit the rate of property taxes which may be imposed by a code county or to regulate the maximum amount of indebtedness which may be incurred by a code county. It is the intent of the General Assembly that this authority should only be exercised when there is the possibility that the code county is imposing an excessive rate of property taxation or is incurring indebtedness in an excessive amount.</text>
