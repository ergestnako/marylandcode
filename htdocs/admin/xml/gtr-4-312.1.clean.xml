  <text>The Maryland Transportation Authority shall take whatever steps may be necessary to obtain a modification of the trust agreement, dated as of July 1, 1978, between the Authority and Maryland National Bank, as trustee, to permit free access to and from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway from the ramps in Harford County and Cecil County. Upon the execution of this modification of the trust agreement, and after the cost of obtaining this modification has been recouped by the State through the accumulated revenues produced by the ramp tolls on the Kennedy Highway in Harford County and Cecil County, the Authority shall eliminate the ramp tolls on the Kennedy Highway in Harford County and Cecil County and may not thereafter charge or collect tolls at these ramps.</text>
