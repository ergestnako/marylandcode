  <text>A proposed Constitutional Amendment which, by provisions that are of limited duration, provides for a period of transition, or a unique schedule under which the terms of the amendment are to become effective, shall set forth those provisions in the amendment as a section or sections of a separate article, to be known as "Provisions of Limited Duration", and state the date upon which or the circumstances under which those provisions shall expire. If the Constitutional Amendment is adopted, those provisions of limited duration shall have the same force and effect as any other part of the Constitution, except that they shall remain a part of the Constitution only so long as their terms require. Each new section of the article known as "Provisions of Limited Duration" shall refer to the title and section of the other article of the Constitution of which it, temporarily, is a part.</text>
