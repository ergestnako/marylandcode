  <text>If the owner of any lands within the watershed association refuses to accept the damages awarded him by the board of watershed viewers and approved by the board of county commissioners, and refuses the necessary access to his lands, the board of watershed directors may condemn rights-of-way, easements, and other property rights necessary for carrying out the works of improvement, and the procedure shall be as provided for in Title 12 of the Real Property Article, and the damages awarded as compensation shall be paid by the board of directors in lieu of the damages awarded by the watershed viewers. Nothing in this subtitle authorizes the use of eminent domain proceedings to acquire the right to use water separate and apart from the land to which it is incident.</text>
