  <text>This subtitle does not affect the rights of a producer of raw agricultural products, who has not signed a contract with a cooperative agricultural marketing association, to bargain for his crop individually with any buyer. A buyer may bargain for any of his raw agricultural product requirements with any cooperative agricultural marketing association but is not required to do so. The inability of a buyer or his refusal to meet the terms and conditions of any cooperative agricultural marketing association proposed contract shall not be interpreted as a boycott or discrimination against the cooperative agricultural marketing association or its members.</text>
