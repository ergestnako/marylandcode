    <section prefix="(a)">If a grant, deed, covenant, or bequest of any land or personal property is to a trustee whose title is nominal only and who has no express power of disposition or management of the property, and is to be held for a beneficiary expressly designated in it, the grant, deed, covenant, or bequest is void as to the trustee, and is a direct grant, deed, covenant, or bequest to the beneficiary.</section>
