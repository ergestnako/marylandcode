  <text>The board of drainage commissioners shall give notice for three weeks by publication in some newspaper published in a county in which the district, or some part thereof, is situated, if there be any such newspaper, and also by posting a written or printed notice at the door of the courthouse and at five conspicuous places in the district, reciting that they propose to issue bonds for the payment of the total cost of improvement, giving the amount of bonds to be issued, the rate of interest that they are to bear and time when payable. Any landowner in the district not wanting to pay interest on the bonds may, within fifteen days after the publication of said notice, pay to the county treasurer the full amount for which his land is liable, to be ascertained from the classification sheet and the certificate of the board showing the total cost of the improvement, and have his lands released from liability to be assessed for the said improvement; but such land shall continue liable for any future assessment for maintenance or for any increased assessment authorized under the law.</text>
