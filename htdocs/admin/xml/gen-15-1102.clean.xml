  <text>It is the intention of the General Assembly to promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation which continue to degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public. To accomplish these objectives, the Department is hereby authorized to administer an abandoned mine reclamation program consistent with the requirements of the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.</text>
