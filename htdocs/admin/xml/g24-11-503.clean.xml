    <section prefix="(a)">Except in Carroll County, the county commissioners of the counties shall prepare, and furnish annually to the county treasurer, and to the tax collecting officer, metal tags to be given the owners of dogs when the owners shall pay the license fee for dogs. The tags shall be of metal, and shall have a serial number corresponding with the number on the license issued to the owner, as provided in &#xA7; 11-501 of this subtitle. The tags shall also have impressed thereon the calendar year for which the tag is issued, and shall not be more than 1 inch in length, and shall be equipped with a substantial metal fastening device. The general shape of the tag shall be changed from year to year, and the tags furnished owners of kennels shall have the word "kennel" thereon. If any tag is lost it shall be replaced by the county treasurer, or tax collecting office, upon application by the person to whom the original license was issued, upon the production of the license and payment of a fee of 25 cents.</section>

    <section prefix="(c)">In Anne Arundel County, the expiration date of the dog license, rather than a calendar year, shall be impressed on the tag, and the shape of the tag may remain unchanged from year to year.</section>
