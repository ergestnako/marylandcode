  <text>Within ten years after July 1, 1971, the Secretary shall review every roadless area of 500 contiguous acres or more in the State-owned lands under his jurisdiction on July 1, 1971. Every area of State-owned roadless islands, State wildlife refuges, and public hunting areas under his jurisdiction on July 1, 1971 shall be reported to the Governor together with the Secretary's recommendation as to the suitability or nonsuitability of each area or island for preservation as a wildland. The Governor shall advise the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Delegates of his recommendation with respect to the designation as wildland of each area or island on which review has been completed, and submit a map, and a definition of its boundaries. The advice shall be given with respect to not less than one third of the areas and islands to be reviewed under this subsection by July 1, 1974, not less than two thirds by July 1, 1978, and the remainder by July 1, 1981. A recommendation of the Governor for designation as wildland becomes effective only if provided by an act of the General Assembly. Nothing contained in this title may be construed, by implication or otherwise, to lessen the present statutory authority of the Secretary with respect to maintenance of roadless areas under his jurisdiction.</text>
