  <text>The collected assessments shall be paid into the certified agency treasury to be used together with any other funds from other sources, including donations from any person and grants from the State or governmental agencies, to promote and stimulate, by advertising and other methods, the increased domestic and foreign use and sale of the agricultural commodity covered by the referendum. The assessments also may be used to finance research and education programs or to contribute toward the financing of a program on production, use, and sale of any agricultural commodity. The assessments may be used to support multistate, area, or national programs whose purposes are essentially the same as those of the State producers.</text>
