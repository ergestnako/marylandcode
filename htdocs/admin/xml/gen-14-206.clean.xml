  <text>Gas injected into underground storage in Prince George's County which remains under the surface of land in the county, unless and until it is disposed of with the consent of the gas storage company, shall remain the personal property of the company. It is not subject to production, taking, reduction to possession, waste, or interference by the owner of the surface of the land or by any other person except the company or its authorized agents. Gas injected into underground storage in Prince George's County and which is found under the surface of any land in Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary's counties other than in gas mains is subject to the property rights of the captor of the gas or the owner of the land, in all respects as though the gas occurred there naturally. In such a case, the owner of the land may alternatively elect to proceed against the gas storage company for his damages.</text>
