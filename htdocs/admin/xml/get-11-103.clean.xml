    <section prefix="(a)">In applying the rule against perpetuities to an interest limited to take effect at or after the termination of one or more life estates in, or lives of, persons in being when the period of the rule commences to run, the validity of the interest shall be determined on the basis of facts existing at the termination of one or more life estates or lives. In this section an interest which must terminate not later than the death of one or more persons is a "life estate" even though it may terminate at an earlier date.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">If an interest would violate the rule against perpetuities as modified by subsection (a) of this section because the interest is contingent upon any person attaining or failing to attain an age in excess of 21, the age contingency shall be reduced to 21 as to all persons subject to the same age contingency.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">This section shall apply to both legal and equitable interests.</section>
