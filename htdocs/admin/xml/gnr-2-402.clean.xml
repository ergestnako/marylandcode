  <text>The Survey shall examine, at least once every ten years, every monument which marks the boundaries of the State. Whenever the Survey finds the monument is lost, removed, or displaced causing the boundary to become obscure, inaccurate, or incorrect, it shall cooperate with the proper officials and agencies of the adjacent state, commonwealth, or district to replace, restore, or repair the monuments on the common boundary line. The Survey, on behalf of the State, may make any joint agreement or contract with appropriate officials or agencies of any adjacent state, commonwealth, or district, and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, or any similar disinterested party or agency, to resurvey, remark, or otherwise delineate more clearly any part of any common boundary between the State and any adjacent state, commonwealth, or district. In any resurvey, the present established boundaries of the State shall be preserved with the greatest possible fidelity.</text>
