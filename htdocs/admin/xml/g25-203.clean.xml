    <section prefix="(a)">As an alternate plan for raising funds necessary to carry out the plan of watershed improvements described in the watershed work plan and approved by the county commissioners, as provided in &#xA7; 202 of this subtitle, the board of directors shall have the power to issue and sell bonds or notes for an amount not exceeding the total cost of the improvements as hereinafter provided.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">The board of directors shall give notice at least once a week for not less than three weeks by publication in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county in which the watershed association area or some part thereof is situated, if there be such a newspaper, and also by posting for at least 15 days a notice at the door of the courthouse of such county and at four public places within the watershed association, or in the vicinity thereof, reciting the fact that they propose to issue bonds or notes for the payment of the cost of improvement, giving the amount of bonds or notes to be issued, the rate of interest that they are to bear or the method of determining the same, and the time when payable. Any landowner may within fifteen days after the publication or posting of such notice pay to the county treasurer the full amount for which his land is liable, to be ascertained from the report of the watershed viewers, and have his lands and himself relieved from further liability for the particular improvement. Prior to issuing any bonds or notes under this section, the board of directors shall deduct from the estimated amount of bonds or notes to be issued, the amount or amounts so paid in advance, and shall issue bonds or notes only in the decreased amount. Any amount or amounts so paid in advance to the county treasurer shall be held by him in a separate fund, to be added to the proceeds of the bonds or notes issued and to be expended with such proceeds to carry out the plan of watershed improvements.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">The board of directors shall certify to the county commissioners the amount of bonds or notes which are to be issued. Along with such certification the board of directors shall submit a tax roll of all properties for which payments have not been made, showing for each landowner the full amount, less interest, for which his land is liable. The total of these amounts for the several landowners shall equal the amount so certified to the county commissioners.</section>
    <section prefix="(d)">The board of directors shall thereupon proceed to issue bonds or notes, in the amount which has been certified to the county commissioners. All bonds or notes issued under this section shall be sold under the serial maturity plan and shall have a maturity date not over twelve years from the date of issue, and no such bonds or notes shall be sold for a price less than par. Such bonds or notes may be sold at either public or private sale, and the form, date, interest rate or rates, and all other details incident to the offering, sale, execution and delivery of the bonds, within the limitations above set forth, shall be within the discretion of the board of directors. Bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall be exempt from the provisions of Article 31, &#xA7;&#xA7; 9 to 11, inclusive, of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957 Edition) as amended from time to time. The proceeds therefrom shall be paid over by the board of directors to the county treasurer, who shall retain them in a special fund to be disbursed only upon warrant of the board of directors. The proceeds therefrom shall be devoted entirely to carrying out the plan of watershed improvements, except that any surplus resulting therefrom shall be used in the redemption of said bonds.</section>
    <section prefix="(e)">The board of directors shall certify to the county commissioners and to the county treasurer the total amount due each year for the redemption of the bonds or notes so issued including all payments of principal and interest. The county treasurer shall compute each year the amount due from each individual landowner, based upon the amounts shown in the watershed tax roll, in such manner that the total of amounts individually due shall equal in any year the aggregate sum required in that year for the redemption of the bonds or notes and interest. The county treasurer shall include in his regular tax bill for each taxable year, the sum as so computed. Such watershed taxes shall be due and collectible at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes, and shall be liable to the same interest and penalties for late payment or nonpayment.</section>
    <section prefix="(f)">Except as provided in this section, the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 169 to 218 of this subtitle shall apply in all respects to watershed improvements made under this section as if made from funds by assessments without issuing bonds or notes.</section>
    <section prefix="(g)">If the watershed work plan approved by the county commissioners provides for taking over or adopting as the whole or as part of the watershed improvements to be provided under this subtitle, any works of improvement already constructed, the board of directors may pay from the proceeds of any bonds or notes issued under the provisions of this section the amount necessary to acquire such works of improvement, or to reimburse any landowners for any amounts expended by them in the construction thereof.</section>
    <section prefix="(h)">The county treasurer shall report to the board of directors at regular intervals, whatever amounts he may have collected as taxes during such periods, with a list showing the amount received from each landowner. The board of directors shall order all such moneys to be paid by the county treasurer for the redemption of the bonds or notes issued and the interest thereon.</section>
    <section prefix="(i)">If any installment of principal or interest represented by the said bonds or notes shall not be paid at the time and in the manner the same shall become due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of six months, the holder or holders of such bond or note or bonds or notes in default shall have a right of action against the board of directors. The circuit court of the county may issue a writ of mandamus against the board of directors, directing the levying of a tax or special assessment against the landowners in default and the collection of the same in such sum as may be necessary to meet any unpaid installments of principal and interest and the costs of the action. The amount of the tax or special assessment shall be certified by the board of directors to the county treasurer who shall proceed immediately to collect the same from the landowners so in default according to the procedure provided in &#xA7;&#xA7; 202 through 206 of this subtitle, and when such sums have been collected the county treasurer shall, upon order of the board of directors pay the said unpaid installments of principal and interest in default and the costs of the action. The official bonds of the county treasurer and the other officers shall be liable for the faithful performance of the duties assigned to them under this subtitle. The holder or holders of any bond or note or bonds or notes in default are hereby authorized to institute suit against any officer on his official bond for failing to perform any of the duties required of him pursuant to this section.</section>
