Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws.</section><section prefix="1.">Rule making authority. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rule making authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Compact, or the powers granted under this Compact, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.</section><section prefix="2.">Rule making procedure. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rule making process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981, as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. Before the Commission adopts a uniform standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committees in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard. The Commission, in adopting a uniform standard, shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.</section><section prefix="3.">Effective date and opt out of a uniform standard. A uniform standard shall become effective 90 days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this article. "Opt out" shall be defined as any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard. All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure, or amendment.</section><section prefix="4.">Opt out procedure. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the insurance department under the compacting state's administrative procedure act or duly promulgated pursuant to the compacting state's law. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by regulation, it must: (i) give written notice to the Commission no later than 10 business days after the uniform standard is promulgated, or at a time the state becomes a compacting state; and (ii) find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state. The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this Compact; and (ii) the presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.</section><section prefix="5.">Effect of opt out. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time as the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.</section><section prefix="6.">Stay of uniform standard. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the Commission, at least 15 days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to 90 days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, that a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than 1 year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission on notice that the rule making process has been terminated.</section><section prefix="7.">Not later than 30 days after a rule or operating procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commission's authority.</section><section prefix="1.">The Commission shall promulgate rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The Commission may promulgate additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law-enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.</section><section prefix="2.">Except as to privileged records, data, and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data, or information to the Commission; provided, that disclosure to the Commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Compact, the Commission shall not be subject to the compacting state's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data, and information in its possession. Confidential information of the Commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any commissioner.</section><section prefix="3.">The Commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The Commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with Commission bylaws, rules, or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV.</section><section prefix="4.">The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise the commissioner's authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state's law. The commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the Compact is governed by the following provisions:<section prefix="A.">With respect to the commissioner's market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved by or certified to the Commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards, or requirements of the Compact except on a final order of the Commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.</section><section prefix="B.">Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard, or requirement of the Compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved by or certified to the Commission, the Commission, or an authorized Commission officer or employee, must authorize the action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for a hearing, disclosure of requests for authorization, or disclosure of records of the Commission's action on such requests.</section></section><section prefix="1.">Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the Commission shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the Commission. Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the insurance department in any state in which the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.</section><section prefix="2.">The Commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to Commission rules and operating procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Commission shall promulgate rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the Commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such rules, the Commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as the protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets that may be contained in a product filing or supporting information.</section><section prefix="3.">Any product approved by the Commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.</section><section prefix="1.">Not later than 30 days after the Commission has given notice of a disapproved product or advertisement filed with the Commission, the insurer or third-party filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and a hearing. An allegation that the Commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the Commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with Article III, Section 4.</section><section prefix="2.">The Commission shall have authority to monitor, review, and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval on a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the Commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in Section 1 of this article.</section><section prefix="1.">The Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the Commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, compacting states, and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the Commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.</section><section prefix="2.">The Commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third-party filer filing a product with the Commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the Commission's annual budget.</section><section prefix="3.">The Commission's budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in Article VII of this Compact.</section><section prefix="4.">The Commission shall be exempt from all taxation in and by the compacting states.</section><section prefix="5.">The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any compacting state, except by and with the appropriate legal authority of that compacting state.</section><section prefix="6.">The Commission shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all its internal receipts, including grants and donations, and disbursements of all funds under its control. The internal financial accounts of the Commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its bylaws. The financial accounts and reports, including the system of internal controls and procedures of the Commission, shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. On the determination of the Commission, but no less frequently than every 3 years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the Commission. The Commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The Commission's internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the commissioner of any compacting state on request; provided, however, that any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers' proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.</section><section prefix="7.">No compacting state shall have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the Commission or to any Commission funds held pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.</section><section prefix="1.">Any state is eligible to become a compacting state.</section><section prefix="2.">The Compact shall become effective and binding on legislative enactment of the Compact into law by two compacting states; provided, that the Commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting uniform standards for, reviewing, and giving approval or disapproval of, products filed with the Commission that satisfy applicable uniform standards only after 26 states are compacting states; or, alternatively, by states representing greater than 40 percent of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income, and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the NAIC for the prior year. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state on enactment of the Compact into law by that state.</section><section prefix="3.">Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding on the Commission and the compacting states unless and until all compacting states enact the amendment into law.</section><section prefix="1.">Withdrawal.<section prefix="A.">Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the Compact (withdrawing state) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.</section><section prefix="B.">The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the Commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in subsection E of this section.</section><section prefix="C.">The commissioner of the withdrawing state immediately shall notify the management committee in writing on the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the withdrawing state.</section><section prefix="D.">The Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the introduction of such legislation within 10 days after its receipt of notice thereof.</section><section prefix="E.">The withdrawing state is responsible for all obligations, duties, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the Commission and the withdrawing state. The Commission's approval of products and advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state, unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.</section><section prefix="F.">Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur on the effective date of the withdrawing state reenacting the Compact.</section></section><section prefix="2.">Default.<section prefix="A.">If the Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (defaulting state) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under the Compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules or operating procedures, then, after notice and a hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact on the defaulting state shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the Commission. The grounds for default include the failure of a compacting state to perform its obligations or responsibilities and any other grounds designated in Commission rules.
