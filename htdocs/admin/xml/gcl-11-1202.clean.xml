    <section prefix="(d)">In appropriate circumstances, affirmative acts to protect a trade secret may be compelled by court order.</section>
    <section prefix="(e)">In this section, "exceptional circumstances" includes a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation that renders a prohibitive injunction inequitable.</section>
