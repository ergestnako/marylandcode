Any bonds, notes or other certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this section shall be issued as generally provided in this subtitle, except they shall not be district obligations and payments of principal and interest shall be met by a countywide tax. Also, the board of county commissioners or county council shall not be constituted as a district council. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this section, all the provisions of this subtitle shall apply to any erosion control works undertaken and to any bonds, notes or other certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this section, it being the legislative intent that this section merely provides an alternative and countywide means of financing erosion control works on a countywide basis.</text>
