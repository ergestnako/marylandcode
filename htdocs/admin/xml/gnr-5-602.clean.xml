  <text>Forests, timberlands, woodlands, and soil resources of the State are basic assets, and the proper use, development, and preservation of these resources are necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the State. It is the policy of the State to encourage economic management and scientific development of its forests and woodlands to maintain, conserve, and improve the soil resources of the State so that an adequate source of forest products is preserved for the people. Floods and soil erosion must be prevented and the natural beauty of the State preserved. Wildlife must be protected, while the development of recreational interest is encouraged and the fertility and productivity of the soil is maintained. The impairment of reservoirs and dams must be prevented, the tax rate preserved, and the welfare of the people of the State sustained and promoted. Where these interests can be served through cooperative efforts of private forest landowners, with the assistance of the State, it is the policy of the State to encourage, assist, and guide private ownership in the management and fullest economic development of privately owned forest lands. Where these public interests cannot be served and adequately protected under private ownership, it is the policy of the State to acquire control of, and title to these lands as rapidly as the financial resources of the State permit.</text>
