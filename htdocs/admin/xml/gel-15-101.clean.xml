  <text>The General Assembly recognizes that our system of representative government depends in part on guaranteeing that election campaigns are funded by and for the people and on eliminating the corrupting and undemocratic effects of large private contributions. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds and declares that an equitable means of public campaign financing is necessary in these times in order for representative democracy to continue to function effectively.</text>
