  <text>A license does not lapse if the licensee fails to renew or make bona fide use of his license because of induction or enlistment into the armed forces or employment in essential war industries, and the licensee applies to the Department for the renewal of his license within one year of the termination of hostilities or from the date of his release from the armed forces. If a licensee cannot fish every net for which he was licensed at any time during a war emergency because of some condition arising out of a war, he may not be deprived of his right to a license for these nets thereafter.</text>
