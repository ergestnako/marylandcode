  <text>The Interstate Mining Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:<section prefix="(a)">The party states find that:<section prefix="1.">Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance.</section><section prefix="2.">The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public.</section><section prefix="3.">Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern.</section><section prefix="4.">Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources; but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated.</section><section prefix="5.">The states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.</section></section><section prefix="(b)">The purposes of this compact are to:<section prefix="1.">Advance the protection and restoration of land, water and other resources affected by mining.</section><section prefix="2.">Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to mining.</section><section prefix="3.">Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.</section><section prefix="4.">Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources.</section><section prefix="5.">Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.</section></section><section prefix="(a)">"Mining" means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter; any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location; and the preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use; but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface, and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on site farming or construction.</section><section prefix="(b)">"State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States.</section><section prefix="1.">The protection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property formerly used in the conduct of such operations.</section><section prefix="2.">The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of land and water.</section><section prefix="3.">The institution and maintenance of suitable programs for adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands.</section><section prefix="4.">The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past and future.</section><section prefix="1.">Study mining operations, processes and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional development or change.</section><section prefix="2.">Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining.</section><section prefix="3.">Make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact.</section><section prefix="4.">Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact.</section><section prefix="5.">Cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interests in any subject coming within the purview of this compact.</section><section prefix="6.">Consult, upon the request of a party state and within resources available therefor, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact.</section><section prefix="7.">Study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operations.</section><section prefix="8.">Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites.</section><section prefix="(a)">There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the "Interstate Mining Commission", hereinafter called "the commission". The commission shall be composed of one commissioner from each party state who shall be the governor thereof.

No action of the commission making a recommendation pursuant to Article IV-3, IV-7, and IV-8 or requesting, accepting or disposing of funds, services, or other property pursuant to this paragraph, Articles V (g), V (h), or VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission is cast in favor thereof. All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting: provided that action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners, or their alternates, is present.

The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one half in equal shares, and the remainder in proportion to the value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined. In determining such values, the commission shall employ such available public source or sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.</section><section prefix="(c)">The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state.

Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.</section><section prefix="(b)">Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.</section></text>
