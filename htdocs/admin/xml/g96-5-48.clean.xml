  <text>In every city, county or other political subdivision of the State in which appointments to positions in the municipal or county government are made under any civil service or merit system law or ordinance, the commission or board which provides eligible lists for appointment shall promulgate rules or regulations granting special credit or credits to honorably discharged veterans of the military and naval services of the United States and who have been residents of this State for five years or more immediately preceding the date on which such veterans take any merit system examination. The said commission or board shall have the power to determine the nature and extent of the special credit or credits to be allowed such veterans and may allow a greater credit or credits to disabled veterans than to nondisabled veterans. The same credit, credits or preference may be extended to the spouses of such veterans as have themselves been unable to qualify for merit system appointment because of disability and to the unmarried surviving spouses of deceased veterans. The rules and regulations of any civil service commission or board may also provide for exempting such war veterans under fifty-five years of age from any age limitation or requirement.</text>
