  <text>Whenever any improvement constructed under &#xA7;&#xA7; 103 through 121H of this article is completed it shall be under the control and supervision of the board of drainage commissioners. It shall be the duty of the said board to keep the levee, ditch, drain or watercourse in good repair, and for this purpose they may levy an assessment on the lands benefited by the construction of such improvement in the same manner and in the same proportion as the original assessments were made for an amount not to exceed twenty-five percent of the original assessment, and the fund that is collected shall be used for repairing and maintaining the ditch, drain or watercourse in perfect order. Provided, however, that if any repairs are made necessary by the act or negligence of the owner of any land through which such improvement is constructed or by the act or negligence of his agent or employee, or if the same is caused by the cattle, hogs or other stock of said owner, employee or agent, then the cost thereof shall be assessed and levied against the lands of said owner alone, to be collected by proper suit instituted by the drainage commissioners. It shall be unlawful for any person to injure or damage or obstruct or build any bridge, fence or floodgate in such a way as to injure or damage any levee, ditch, drain or watercourse constructed or improved under the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 103 through 121H of this article, and any person causing such injury shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof may be fined in any sum not exceeding twice the damage or injury done or caused.</text>
