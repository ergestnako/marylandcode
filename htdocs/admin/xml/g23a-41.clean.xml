  <text>An entire repeal of the charter of a municipal corporation, and the termination of the existence of the municipal corporation, may be accomplished as generally provided above in the subheading "Charter Amendments". The resolution of the legislative body of the municipal corporation or the petition of 20 percent or more of the qualified voters need not contain the text of the charter which it is proposed to repeal, but may simply state the fact of the proposed repeal. The posting and publication of the proposed repeal also may simply state that fact, as may the submission of the charter amendment resolution reflecting a favorable vote with the Department of Legislative Services, as provided in &#xA7; 9A of this article. From and after the time that the charter stands repealed it no longer may be included in any subsequent edition or printing of the code of public local laws of the county or State.</text>
