    <section prefix="(a)">The provisions of all laws, ordinances, and regulations concerning building codes or zoning shall have full force and effect to the extent that they apply to property which is subjected to a condominium regime and shall be construed and applied with reference to the overall nature and use of the property without regard to the form of ownership. A law, ordinance, or regulation concerning building codes or zoning may not establish any requirement or standard governing the use, location, placement or construction of any land and improvements which are submitted to the provisions of this title, unless the requirement or standard is uniformly applicable to all land and improvements of the same kind or character not submitted to the provisions of this title.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">Except as otherwise provided in this title, a county, city, or other jurisdiction may not enact any law, ordinance, or regulation which would impose a burden or restriction on a condominium that is not imposed on all other property of similar character not subjected to a condominium regime. Any such law, ordinance, or regulation, is void. Except as otherwise expressly provided in &#xA7;&#xA7; 11-130, 11-138, 11-139, and 11-140 of this title, the provisions of this title are statewide in their effect. Any law, ordinance, or regulation enacted by a county, city, or other jurisdiction is preempted by the subject and material of this title.</section>
