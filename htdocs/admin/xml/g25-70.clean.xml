  <text>It is the duty of the board of county commissioners upon review and approval of the watershed plan to appoint a board of drainage viewers, to be composed of three or more judicious and impartial citizens, residing in the vicinity of the watershed provided, however, that no member of the board of drainage viewers shall be the owner of any land which will be affected by the proposed improvements. Where the works of improvement described in the watershed work plan are located in two or more counties, there shall be at least one member of the viewers from each county in which such works of improvement are located. A person appointed as a member of the board of drainage viewers may not act in that capacity until that person has given the board of county commissioners written notice of acceptance of the appointment.</text>
