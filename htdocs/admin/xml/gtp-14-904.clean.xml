    <section prefix="(a)">A person who submits a written refund claim to the appropriate collector for State property tax erroneously or mistakenly paid to the collector is eligible for a refund from the State Treasury of the amount of State property tax paid that exceeds the amount that is properly and legally chargeable to or collectible from the person.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">If the assessment on which State property tax is payable has become final and has not been appealed as provided by Subtitle 5 of this title, a person is eligible for a refund of State property tax only if the person paid a tax bill that is erroneous because of a mathematical error, mechanical error, error in the property description, or other clerical error made by the taxing authority or assessing authority, and not because of an error of valuation.</section>
