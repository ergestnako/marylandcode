    <section prefix="(a)">A party state may make application for assistance from the Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the governing board or executive committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this section.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">At or in connection with any meeting of the governing board or executive committee held pursuant to &#xA7; 5-706 of this compact, a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the governing board or executive committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review of any determination made by the executive committee.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">The governing board or executive committee shall authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them. The governing board or executive committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of moneys from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside of party states.</section>
