    <section prefix="(a)">The citizens of a chartered county have the right to reserve to themselves the power of referendum by which they may, by petition, submit to the registered voters of the county any local law, or portion of any local law, enacted in accordance with the legislative procedure of the county council. If reserved, this right shall be set forth in the charter of the county which shall specify the types of local laws which may be petitioned to referendum and whether portions of laws may be petitioned to referendum.</section>
