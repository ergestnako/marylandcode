  <text>An agreement that is otherwise sufficiently definite to be a contract is not invalid because it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties. If particulars of performance are to be specified by a party, the following rules apply:<section prefix=""><section prefix="(1)">Specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.</section><section prefix="(2)">If a specification materially affects the other party's performance but is not seasonably made, the other party:<section prefix="(A)">Is excused for any resulting delay in its performance; and</section><section prefix="(B)">May perform, suspend performance, or treat the failure to specify as a breach of contract.</section></section></section></text>
