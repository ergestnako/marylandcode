    <section prefix="(a)">A money judgment entered in an action arising from a contract for the loan of money shall carry interest at the rate charged in the contract on any balance remaining unpaid until the date of maturity of the contract as originally scheduled. However, the rate of interest shall be on the unpaid principal of the money borrowed. The provisions of this section do not apply to any loan secured by a mortgage or deed of trust. The provisions of this section do not apply when the contractual rate of interest for a student loan of money is less than the prevailing legal rate of interest allowable on the judgment, as set forth in &#xA7; 11-107 of this subtitle, unless the agreement for the loan of money expressly provides otherwise.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">In this section, "student loan" means any loan or advance of funds, money, or credit to an individual by an institution of higher learning or a lender to defray, in part or in full, educational or educational related expenses. It includes national defense, national direct, health professional, and nursing student loans.</section>
