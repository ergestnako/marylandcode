The collector, upon surrender of a receipt or of any other instrument evidencing payment of the necessary part of the purchase price, shall deliver to the purchaser a certificate signed by the collector containing all available information concerning the prior sale. Any certificate issued under this subtitle shall have the same force and effect as other certificates issued under the provisions of this subtitle and shall be subject to all of the provisions of this subtitle relating to any other certificates of sale. Any collector may issue the certificate provided for in this subtitle, notwithstanding the fact that any prior tax sale was made by one of his predecessors in office.
