  <text>The board of directors shall, upon completion of the watershed work plan, or acceptance of a previously completed watershed work plan, call a meeting of the owners of land within the watershed association for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the plan for submission to the board of county commissioners. The board of directors shall give at least ten days' notice of the meeting by notices posted in four public places within the association or in the vicinity thereof and by written or printed notices mailed to each owner of land within such association stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting. At such meeting, each landowner within the watershed association shall be entitled to one vote. Any such landowner may vote by proxy if the proxy is dated, signed by the person entitled to vote, and duly witnessed by at least one person. The board of directors shall determine whether the plan shall be transmitted to the board of county commissioners for review and approval. In making such determination the board of directors shall consider the vote, the probable apportionment of benefits based on acreage, location, and extent of such benefits to such voter's land by the works of improvement.</text>
