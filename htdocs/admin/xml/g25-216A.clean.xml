  <text>If, at any time after the county commissioners have reviewed and approved the watershed work plan under &#xA7; 187 of this subtitle, the board of directors determine that it is to the interest of the public watershed association to change or modify the purpose, scope, or location of the works of improvement covered in the watershed work plan such that the benefits and/or damages to affected landowners are changed, the board of directors shall proceed as provided in &#xA7; 184 of this subtitle to develop a supplemental watershed work plan including the modified works of improvement. Thereafter, the board of directors and the county commissioners shall follow the procedures outlined in &#xA7; 185 of this subtitle and subsequent sections in putting the supplemental work plan into effect. When the county commissioners have approved a watershed viewers' report based upon a supplemental work plan developed and submitted under this section it shall supersede any prior viewers' report.</text>
