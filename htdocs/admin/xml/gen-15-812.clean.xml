    <section prefix="(a)">The General Assembly finds that in certain regions of the State dewatering of surface mines located in karst terrain may significantly interfere with water supply wells and may cause in some instances sudden subsidence of land, known as sinkholes. Dewatering in karst terrain may result in property damage to landowners in a definable zone of dewatering influence around a surface mine.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">It is the intent of the General Assembly to protect affected property owners in Baltimore, Carroll, Frederick, and Washington counties where karst terrain is found by directing the Department to establish zones of dewatering influence around surface mines in karst terrain and to administer a program requiring permittees to mitigate or compensate affected property owners in these counties.</section>
