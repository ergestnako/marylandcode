    <section prefix="(a)">For the purpose of more precisely defining the Maryland Coordinate System, the standards of the National Geodetic Survey set out in this section are adopted.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">
      <section prefix="(1)">The Maryland Coordinate System is a Lambert conic conformal projection of the Geodetic Reference System of 1980, having standard parallels at north latitudes 38 degrees 18' and 39 degrees 27', along which parallels the scale shall be exact.</section>
      <section prefix="(2)">The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 77 degrees 00' west longitude and the parallel 37 degrees 40' north latitude.</section>
      <section prefix="(3)">This origin is given the coordinates: Easting=400,000 meters and northing=0 meters.</section>
    </section>
    <section prefix="(c)">For the Maryland Coordinate System, the unit used to convert feet to meters is the United States survey foot, which is 39.37/12 feet for each meter.</section>
    <section prefix="(d)">The position of the Maryland Coordinate System shall be as marked on the ground by triangulation or traverse stations established in conformity with the standards adopted by the National Geodetic Survey for first-order and second-order work, whose:<section prefix="(1)">Geodetic positions have been rigidly adjusted on the North American Datum of 1983; and</section><section prefix="(2)">Plane coordinates have been computed in accordance with this section.</section></section>
