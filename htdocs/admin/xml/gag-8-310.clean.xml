    <section prefix="(a)">If the supervisors of any district find that any provision of the land-use rules and regulations is not being complied with on any parcel of land and that noncompliance tends to increase erosion on the land, and is interfering with prevention or control of erosion on other land in the district, the supervisors may seek relief in the circuit court of the county where the district is located.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">In any case where the person in possession of the land is not the owner, the owner of the land shall be joined as a party defendant.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">The court may provide that upon failure of the defendant to initiate performance of the work within the time specified by the court and complete it with reasonable diligence, the supervisors may enter on the land to perform the work and bring the conditions of the land into compliance with the land-use rules and regulations.</section>
    <section prefix="(d)">The court shall retain jurisdiction of the case until the work is completed. Upon completion of the work pursuant to the order of the court, the supervisors may file a petition with the court stating the costs and expenses sustained by them in performing work and praying judgment with interest. The court may enter a judgment for the amount of the supervisor's costs and expenses, with interest at the rate of 5 percent per year, together with the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee fixed by the court.</section>
