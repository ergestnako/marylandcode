      <section prefix="(3)">The failure of an affordable housing land trust to exercise the right to repurchase does not prohibit the affordable housing land trust from exercising any other right established in the agreement, including the right to share in the proceeds of the first sale to a purchaser following the failure of the land trust to exercise its right to repurchase.</section>
