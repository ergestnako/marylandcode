  <text>At the expiration of three weeks after publication of notice of bond issue, the board of drainage commissioners may issue and sell bonds of the drainage district for an amount equal to the total cost of the improvement less such amounts as shall have been paid in in cash to the county treasurer, plus an amount sufficient to pay interest on the bond issue for the three years next following the date of issue. These bonds shall bear interest, payable semiannually, and shall be paid in ten equal instalments. The first instalment of principal shall mature at the expiration of three years from the date of issue, and one instalment for each succeeding year for nine additional years. The commissioners may sell these bonds at not less than par and devote the proceeds to the payment for the work as it progresses and to the payment of the interest on said bonds for the three years next following the date of issue and to the payment of the other expenses of the district provided for in &#xA7;&#xA7; 103 through 121H of this article. The proceeds from such bonds shall be for the exclusive use of the levee or drainage district specified on their face, and shall be numbered by the board of drainage commissioners and recorded in the drainage record, which record shall set out specifically the lands embraced in the district on which the tax has not been paid in full, which land is to be assessed as hereafter provided. If any instalment of principal or interest represented by the said bond shall not be paid at the time and in the manner when the same shall become due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of six months the holder or holders of such bond or bonds upon which default has been made may have a right of action against said drainage district or the board of drainage commissioners of said district, wherein the court may issue a writ of mandamus against the said drainage district, its officers, including the tax collector and treasurer, directing the levying of a tax or special assessment as herein provided, and the collection of the same, in such sums as may be necessary to meet any unpaid instalments of principal and interest and cost of actions; and such other remedies are hereby vested in the holder or holders of such bond or bonds in default as may be authorized by law; and the right of action is hereby vested in the holder or holders of such bond upon which default has been made, authorizing them to institute suit against any officer on his official bond for failure to perform any duty imposed by the provisions of &#xA7;&#xA7; 103 through 121H of this article. The official bonds of the tax collector and county treasurer shall be liable for the faithful performance of the duties herein assigned them. Such bonds may be increased by the board of county commissioners at their discretion.</text>
