  <text>When a clerk of any court has replaced worn and dilapidated records in his office, and certified the new records as accurate copies of the old ones, the new records are substituted for and become the records of the court in lieu of the old records. The certified and substituted new records are admissible evidence to the same extent the old ones were.</text>
