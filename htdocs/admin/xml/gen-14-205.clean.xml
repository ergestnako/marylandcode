  <text>The right to utilize geological strata for the underground storage of gas, acquired by any gas storage company by eminent domain under &#xA7; 14-202(a) and (b) of this subtitle, is subject to the right of the owner of the land or of other rights or interests, to penetrate the strata for the purpose of exploring or recovering gas not owned by the company or water, oil, or other minerals from other strata. If the owner desires to penetrate the underground gas storage reservoir in order to recover the gas, water, oil, or other minerals from a lower stratum, he may do so provided he gives the company sufficient written notice to permit proper precautions to be taken. The company, after receiving notice, at its expense and responsibility, shall supervise the penetration to assure that it is made in a manner which will not hamper or impair the operation of the underground storage reservoir, result in the pollution of gas stored there, or permit the escape of any gas.</text>
