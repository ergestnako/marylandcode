Therefore, it is the policy of the State to provide, at certain establishments, for the inspection of slaughtered livestock, carcasses, parts of them, meat and meat food products prepared for human food and to impose other requirements to prevent the distribution in intrastate commerce of livestock carcasses, parts of them, meat and meat food products which are adulterated or misbranded and are capable of use as human food.</section>
