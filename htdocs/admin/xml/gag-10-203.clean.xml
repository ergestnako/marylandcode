  <text>After receiving a sworn complaint and holding an informal hearing on the charges made in the complaint, the Attorney General immediately shall bring an action to enjoin the violation of any provision of this subtitle as set forth in the complaint in the circuit court of the county where the violation occurred. A summons in the action against any defendant shall be issued as in other civil actions. Actions against different defendants may be consolidated, in the discretion of the court, if the alleged violations are of the same provision, have occurred in the same or an adjoining county, relate to the same production season, and consolidation can be made without prejudice to a substantial right of any defendant.</text>
