  <text>After an estate has been closed, a claim not barred may be prosecuted against one or more of the persons to whom property has been distributed. An heir or legatee shall not be liable to claimants for amounts in excess of the value of his distribution, valued at the time of distribution or the time of filing suit, whichever is lower. An heir or legatee has a right of contribution against other heirs and legatees; between them each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied before distribution.</text>
