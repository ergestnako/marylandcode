  <text>A person to whom letters are first issued has exclusive authority under the letters until his appointment is terminated or modified. If, in the absence of termination or modification, letters are afterwards issued to another, the first appointed personal representative may recover any property of the estate in the hands of, and demand and secure an accounting from, the personal representative subsequently appointed, but the acts of the latter done in good faith before notice of the first letters, are not void for want of validity of appointment.</text>
