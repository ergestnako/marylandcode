In other cases, if a petition is filed with the court by the personal representative or the claimant, the court may provide for payment in the manner provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">The creditor and personal representative may determine, by agreement, arbitration, or compromise, the value of the claim according to its probable present worth, and, upon approval by the court, it may be allowed and paid in the same manner as an absolute claim.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">The court may order the personal representative to make distribution of the estate except for sufficient funds retained to pay the claim if and when it becomes absolute.</section>
    <section prefix="(d)">The court may order distribution of the estate as though the contingent claim did not exist, but the distributees are liable to the creditor to the extent of the estate received by them, if the contingent claim becomes absolute. The court may require the distributees to give bond for the satisfaction of their liability to the contingent creditor.</section>
