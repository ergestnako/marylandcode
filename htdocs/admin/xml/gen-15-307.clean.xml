  <text>An applicant who is aggrieved by the examining authority's refusal to grant a first-class mine foreman certificate or permit of competence may apply to the Secretary of Budget and Management who shall review the examination. If the Secretary of Budget and Management finds the refusal unwarranted, he shall direct that the applicant be awarded the certificate or permit. If he upholds the decision of the examining authority, the applicant may appeal to the circuit court for the county in which he resides. The court may hear and determine the matter, issuing any order as may be just.</text>
