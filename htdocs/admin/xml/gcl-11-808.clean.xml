    <section prefix="(a)">A consignment of agricultural products by the grower, producer, or owner to a consignee for sale for the use and benefit of the consignor does not vest in the consignee any other title or right to the products except to sell and deliver them to a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">If, without the express consent of the grower, producer, or owner, a consignee mortgages, pledges, deposits, or otherwise disposes of agricultural products consigned only for sale for the use and benefit of the grower, producer, or owner, the disposition is void and title to the products does not pass but remains in the grower, producer, or owner as if no disposition were made.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">Nothing in this section impairs any right of any lien which a consignee acquires or is entitled to for bona fide advances made in money or goods to the grower, producer, or owner on the faith and the security of the consignment.</section>
