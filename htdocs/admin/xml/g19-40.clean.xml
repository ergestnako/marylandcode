The examination shall be made by a certified public accountant in the capacity of either an independent auditor or official auditor of any county or municipal corporation. The auditor shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Maryland Public Accountancy Act. The official auditor shall be approved by the Legislative Auditor for the purposes specified in this section. On such examination, inquiry shall be made into the methods, accuracy, and legality of the accounts, records, files, and reports of each county, municipal corporation, and taxing district. The Legislative Auditor upon the Legislative Auditor's own initiative may review or audit the books, records, and reports of any county, municipal corporation, or taxing district. Any county, municipal corporation, or taxing district may request the Legislative Auditor to audit its books, records, and reports. If the request is approved, the costs of the examination shall be borne by the auditee. The results of the audit shall be reported, subject to &#xA7; 2-1246 of the State Government Article, to the Legislative Auditor on such form or forms and in such manner as the Legislative Auditor may prescribe.

Should any county or municipal corporation, or taxing district fail or refuse to file the audit reports as provided in this section with the Legislative Auditor within the time prescribed or fail or refuse to submit an audit report including financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the State Comptroller, acting upon the advice of the Executive Director of the State Department of Legislative Services, shall be authorized to order the discontinuance of payment of all funds, grants, or State aid which the county, municipal corporation, or taxing district is entitled to receive under State law.
