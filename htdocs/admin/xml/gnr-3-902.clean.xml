  <text>For the benefit of the people of the State of Maryland, the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity, and the improvement of their health and living conditions, it is essential that provision be made for the efficient collection and disposal of waste on a regional basis from both public and private sources in compliance with State and federal laws, regulations, and policies and for the generation of energy and the recovery of useable resources from such waste to the extent practicable. It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist certain participating political subdivisions of this State, other public entities and the private sector of the economy to provide adequate waste disposal facilities (including those which provide for energy generation and resource recovery) and facilities for the generation of steam, electricity, or other forms of energy from fuels which are derived from or are otherwise related to waste disposal facilities by providing a regional coordinating agency and a financing vehicle for such facilities. It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the participating counties to effect waste disposal programs on a regional basis and to that end this subtitle provides for the creation of the Authority. It is the intention and purpose of this subtitle that, without in any way limiting the discretion of the Authority, the Authority and the Maryland Environmental Service cooperate to the maximum extent practicable in effecting a regional waste disposal program in the participating counties.</text>
