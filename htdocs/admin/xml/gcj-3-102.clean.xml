  <text>If the death of a person or the date of his death is at issue, he is not presumed dead in any proceedings under this subtitle or under Title 13 of the Estates and Trusts Article, merely because he has been absent from his place of residence and not heard about for any stated period of time. The issue shall go to the court as one of fact to be determined upon the evidence. If during his absence the person has been exposed to a specific peril of death, this fact shall be considered by the court.</text>
