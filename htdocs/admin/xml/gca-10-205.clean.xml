  <text>If a person required by &#xA7; 10-204 of this subtitle to execute a certificate of amendment or cancellation fails or refuses to do so, any other partner, and any assignee of a partnership interest, who is adversely affected by the failure or refusal, may petition the circuit court for the jurisdiction where the principal office of the partnership is located to direct the amendment or cancellation. If the court finds that the amendment or cancellation is proper and that any person so designated has failed or refused to execute the certificate, the court shall order the Department to record an appropriate certificate of amendment or cancellation.</text>
