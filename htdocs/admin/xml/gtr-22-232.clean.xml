    <section prefix="(a)">When the Administrator has reason to believe that an approved device, as being sold commercially, does not comply with the requirements of this title, after giving 30 days' previous notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for the device in this State, he may conduct a hearing on the question of compliance of the approved device. After the hearing, the Administrator shall determine whether the approved device meets the requirements of this title. If the device does not meet the requirements of this title he shall give notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for the device in this State.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">If, at the expiration of 90 days after the notice, the person holding the certificate of approval for the device has failed to satisfy the Administrator that the approved device as thereafter to be sold meets the requirements of this title, the Administrator shall suspend or revoke the approval issued for the device until the device is resubmitted to and retested by an authorized testing agency and is found to meet the requirements of this title, and the Administrator may require that all the devices sold since the notification following the hearing be replaced with devices that do comply with the requirements of this title. The Administrator may, at the time of the retest, purchase in the open market and submit to the testing agency one or more sets of the approved devices, and, if the device on the retest fails to meet the requirements of this title, the Administrator may refuse to renew the certificate of approval of the device.</section>
