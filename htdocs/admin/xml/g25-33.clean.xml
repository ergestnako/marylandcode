  <text>When any county treasurer, tax collector, county commissioner or any officer, except a clerk of court or sheriff, coming within the common meaning of a county official, in giving the bond required of him by law, shall furnish a bond executed by a surety company, authorized by the laws of the State of Maryland to execute such bonds, and such bonds shall be approved, then in each and every such case the county may pay the premium for such bond, not in any instance to exceed one half of one percent per annum of the penalty of the bond so executed and approved; upon the execution and approval of any such bond the county commissioners may direct the payment of such premium on such bond from the general fund of the county in the same manner as is prescribed for the payment of general county debts; provided, however, that when any such bond is given by a register of wills, or State's Attorney, the payment of the premium on said bond shall be charged as an expense of any such officer.</text>
