  <text>All improvements for watershed protection, flood prevention, recreation, soil conservation, drainage, and/or the conservation, development, storage, utilization, and disposal of water for all beneficial purposes constructed under this subtitle shall be under the control and supervision of the board of directors. It shall be the duty of such board to keep such improvements in good repair. To provide a fund for maintenance, repair, and operation of works of improvement constructed under this subtitle an annual tax shall be levied against the property benefited, the amount of such tax to be equal to the estimated cost of operation and maintenance of works of improvement as determined by an annual inspection or inspections to be made at a time or times set by the board of directors, less such amounts as may be received from the board of county commissioners or from any other source. Should the funds received from the above sources be inadequate to provide for the needed maintenance, repair, or operation, a special tax may be levied against the land benefited. Such taxes shall be levied, collected, and disbursed in the same manner as hereinbefore provided for the original taxes.</text>
