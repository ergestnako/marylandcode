    <section prefix="(c)">In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.</section>
    <section prefix="(d)">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:<section prefix="(1)">The security interest is a purchase-money security interest;</section><section prefix="(2)">The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and</section><section prefix="(3)">The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.</section></section>
    <section prefix="(e)">A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:<section prefix="(1)">The debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:<section prefix="(A)">Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and</section><section prefix="(B)">Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;</section></section><section prefix="(2)">Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this title and the fixtures are readily removable:<section prefix="(A)">Factory or office machines;</section><section prefix="(B)">Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or</section><section prefix="(C)">Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;</section></section><section prefix="(3)">The conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or</section><section prefix="(4)">The security interest is:<section prefix="(A)">Created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and</section><section prefix="(B)">Perfected pursuant to a statute described in &#xA7; 9-311(a)(2).</section></section></section>

    <section prefix="(g)">The priority of the security interest under subsection (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.</section>
    <section prefix="(h)">A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.</section>
