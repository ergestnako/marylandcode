    <section prefix="(b)">Any mechanics' or materialmen's lien arising as a result of repairs to or improvements of the common elements, if authorized in writing by the council of unit owners, shall be paid by the council as a common expense and until paid shall be a lien against each unit in proportion to its percentage interest in the common elements. On payment of the proportionate amount by any unit owner to the lienor or on the filing of a written undertaking in the manner specified by Maryland Rule 12-307, the unit owner is entitled to a recordable release of his unit from the lien and the council of unit owners is not entitled to assess his unit for payment of the remaining amount due for the repairs or improvements.</section>

On payment by any unit owner of his proportionate amount of any judgment resulting from that liability, the unit owner is entitled to a recordable release of his unit from the lien of the judgment and the council of unit owners is not entitled to assess his unit for payment of the remaining amount due.</section>
