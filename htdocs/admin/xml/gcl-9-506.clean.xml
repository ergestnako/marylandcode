    <section prefix="(a)">A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this subtitle is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with &#xA7; 9-503(a) is seriously misleading.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with &#xA7; 9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.</section>
    <section prefix="(d)">For purposes of &#xA7; 9-508(b), the "debtor's correct name" in subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor.</section>
