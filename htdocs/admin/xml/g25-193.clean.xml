  <text>At the hearing, the viewers and engineers being present, any person interested in the matter may appear in person or by counsel and make known his objection to any part of the report. It shall be the duty of the county commissioners to consider carefully such objections, giving full weight to the apportionment of costs and benefits, and if any such objections which are well founded can be met at the time of the hearing by changes in the report, the viewers shall make such changes as are necessary to render substantial and equal justice to all persons concerned. The county commissioners may, in their discretion, disapprove the report, or they may refer it back to the watershed viewers for amendment or reconsideration in view of the objections presented, or they may approve the report as submitted or as it may have been amended. To assist the county commissioners in arriving at a decision, they may, at their discretion, call for a vote of the affected landowners present who are included in the viewers' report, giving due consideration to the apportionment of benefits and damages. Upon approval of the report by the county commissioners the board of directors of the public watershed association shall be empowered to install, operate, and maintain the works of improvement described in the watershed work plan.</text>
