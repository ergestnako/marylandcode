  <text>All roads opened under the provisions of this article shall be at least 30 feet wide, and when opened and sufficiently cleared, shall be public roads. Provided, however, that the County Commissioners of Somerset County may build portions of roads less than 30 feet wide where, in Smith's Island district and in Fairmount district on the road leading from the main county highway to the village of Rumbley, in their discretion, the difficulty or cost of building the said roads to the full width of 30 feet is unwarrantably great. Provided, further, that the County Commissioners of Anne Arundel County are authorized and empowered to take over and maintain as public roads all alleys or roads in Anne Arundel County 20 feet or more in width if such road or alley has been open or dedicated for use as a road or alley since prior to June 1, 1943, and to take over and maintain as public roads alleys in subdivisions platted prior to July 1, 1953, and being of a minimum width of 10 feet; provided, however, in the event that said alleys in said subdivisions do not satisfy the standards and requirements of the State Highway Administration for the purpose of receiving a share of highway user revenues, then the expense of taking over and maintaining said alleys shall be paid by a special tax to be established and levied on the property owners in the particular subdivisions.</text>
