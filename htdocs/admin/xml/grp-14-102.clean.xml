    <section prefix="(b)">If waste is committed after an injunction to stay waste, the court shall ascertain the damage done by the waste, by affidavit or other proof as the court determines necessary, and may fine the defendant to the extent of double the damage ascertained. If the final judgment is in favor of the injured party the court may determine the amount to be paid to him and the remainder shall be applied as a fine. The court may imprison a person who does not comply with the order to pay and may issue execution in the name of the State for its collection.</section>
