    <section prefix="(a)">The departments shall design and operate a comprehensive research and monitoring program through:<section prefix="(1)">New studies on issues affecting the State;</section><section prefix="(2)">Application of the results from ongoing and completed projects sponsored by the State; and</section><section prefix="(3)">The results of research conducted by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program and other programs funded by the federal and state governments or private institutions.</section></section>
    <section prefix="(b)">The comprehensive research and monitoring program shall:<section prefix="(1)">Determine the relative contributions, if any, to acid deposition in the State of various sources of acid deposition precursor emissions;</section><section prefix="(2)">Determine if acid deposition varies significantly from 1 geographic region of the State to another and identify the relative contribution of various sources of precursor emissions responsible for this variability;</section><section prefix="(3)">Expand and improve impact data bases through the compilation of existing data on precipitation and surface water chemistry, improved quality control, and standardization of sampling and analytical techniques;</section><section prefix="(4)">Identify regions, localized areas, or specific ecosystems of the State especially sensitive to acid deposition;</section><section prefix="(5)">Assess the consequence of the environmental impacts of acid deposition on resources such as surface water, groundwater, crops, forests, fisheries, and structures;</section><section prefix="(6)">Identify and evaluate the technological effectiveness, if any, and economic cost of technologies and noncontrol mitigative techniques that are feasible for use in the State to control acid deposition precursor emissions or to mitigate the impact of acid deposition;</section><section prefix="(7)">Identify and monitor activities of the federal government and private industry towards development of innovative technologies for cleaner coal combustion that are feasible for possible use in the State to reduce acid deposition precursor emissions from facilities in the State;</section><section prefix="(8)">Document and apply all current federal, State, and other monitoring and research results related to acid deposition relevant to the State to insure that State activities are coordinated to prevent unnecessary duplication and waste of financial and technical resources;</section><section prefix="(9)">Evaluate issues concerning implementation that may arise due to federal acid deposition control legislation, including:<section prefix="(i)">The examination of the regulatory authority of the Commission and the Department of the Environment to implement a federally enacted emissions control program; and</section><section prefix="(ii)">The identification and analysis of issues such as nitrogen oxide controls, cost sharing, emissions trading, and costs of controls that may be applied to the industrial, mobile, and residential sectors versus the utility sector;</section></section><section prefix="(10)">Initiate research and monitoring projects that are found to be necessary to augment information related to the sources and impacts of acid deposition affecting the State; and</section><section prefix="(11)">Examine the possible contribution to the control and reduction of acid deposition through energy management, enhanced conservation activities by electric utilities, and development of alternative sources of energy.</section></section>
