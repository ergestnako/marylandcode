    <section prefix="(b)">If interest charged pursuant to &#xA7; 12-1003 of this subtitle in respect of a loan to a consumer borrower has been precomputed, then, in the event of prepayment of the entire loan, the credit grantor shall refund or credit to the borrower the unearned portion of the precomputed interest charge. This refund or credit shall be in an amount not less than the amount which would be refunded or credited if the unearned precomputed interest charge were calculated in accordance with the actuarial method, except that the borrower may not be entitled to a refund or credit of less than $5. The unearned portion of the precomputed interest charge is, at the option of the credit grantor, either:<section prefix="(1)">That portion of the precomputed interest charge which is allocable to all originally scheduled or, if deferred, all deferred payment periods, or portions of payment periods, ending subsequent to the date of prepayment. The unearned precomputed interest charge is the total of that which would have been earned for each period, or portion of a period, had the loan not been prepaid, by applying to the unpaid balances of principal, according to the actuarial method, an annual percentage rate based on the precomputed interest charges, assuming that all payments were made as scheduled, or as deferred, if deferred. The credit grantor, at its option, may round this annual percentage rate to the nearest 1/4 of 1 percent; or</section><section prefix="(2)">The total precomputed interest charge less the earned precomputed interest charge. The earned precomputed interest charge shall be determined by applying an annual percentage rate based on the total precomputed interest charge, under the actuarial method, to the unpaid balances for the actual time those balances were unpaid up to the date of prepayment.</section></section>
