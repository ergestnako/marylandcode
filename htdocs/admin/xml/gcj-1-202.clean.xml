    <section prefix="(b)">A person who has been adjudicated guilty of contempt for failure to pay a monetary amount specified in a decree or order passed in a civil proceeding is not barred by reason of the adjudication of contempt from filing a petition for modification of the decree or order, requesting any other relief, or proceeding to hearing on a petition, even though the contempt has not been purged or removed. A petition filed prior to actual adjudication of contempt may be consolidated in the discretion of the court and heard with a citation for contempt, if the petition is at issue and ready for disposition in accordance with the practice in the court in which the matter is pending.</section>
