  <text>For the purpose of raising funds necessary to carry out the plan of watershed improvements described in the report of the watershed viewers and approved by the county commissioners, the board of directors shall decide upon the amount to be raised, which sum may be less than the total assessment, and shall prepare a tax roll showing the sum or amount due from each landowner listed as subject to assessment in the report made out and returned by the watershed viewers and approved by the county commissioners. Such taxes shall be proportional to the respective assessments. Said tax roll shall be signed by the directors and shall by them be sent to the clerk of the board of county commissioners, who shall certify to the county commissioners its conformance to the provisions of this section. The county commissioners shall thereupon certify the tax roll to the county treasurer, who shall include such taxes in the next bills for State and county taxes sent out from his office. Such taxes shall be due and collectible at the same time and in the same manner as county taxes, and shall be liable to the same penalties for late payment and nonpayment as county taxes. Should the funds raised in this manner be insufficient to complete the plan of works of improvement a subsequent tax or taxes shall be levied and collected in like manner.</text>
