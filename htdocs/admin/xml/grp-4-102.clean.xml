  <text>If a deed contains a covenant by the grantee or a reservation of an incorporeal interest in the property granted by the deed and is signed only by the grantor (deed poll), the acceptance of delivery of the deed by the grantee binds the grantee to the provisions in the deed as effectively as if he had signed the deed as a grantee.</text>
