  <text>The Secretary may review, as to its suitability for preservation as State wildlands, any area under his jurisdiction which he deems worthy of consideration for protection as State wildland. He shall report his findings to the Governor. The Governor shall advise the General Assembly of his recommendations with respect to the designation as State "wildland" or reclassification of each area on which a review has been completed and submit maps and a definition of boundaries. Each recommendation of the Governor for designation as "wildland" becomes effective only if provided by an act of the General Assembly. Nothing contained in this title limits the Governor in proposing, as part of his recommendations to the General Assembly, the alteration of boundaries of proposed State wildland areas or recommending the addition of any contiguous area of State lands predominately of wildland value.</text>
