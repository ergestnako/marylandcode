  <text>After receiving reports of property presumed abandoned under this title, the Administrator may decline to receive any property reported which he considers to be valued at less than the cost of giving notice or of holding a sale. He may postpone taking possession until a sufficient sum accumulates, if he considers it desirable because of the small sum involved.</text>
