  <text>The Department shall divide the State into convenient districts, having due regard for the character and extent of the timber stand, similarity of forest problems, convenience of administration, and other pertinent factors. It shall establish, by appointment, in each district created, a district forestry board of at least five members. The appointments to the district forestry board shall include, if possible, a person representing each of the major types of forestry and woodworking interests, and at least one person representing farm woodland owners preferably connected with a county farm bureau or grange in the district. If there are any county agricultural agents and county foresters representing areas lying within the district, they shall have the privilege of participating, without a vote, in the board meeting.</text>
