  <text>Property distributed pursuant to &#xA7; 3-302 of this subtitle shall be paid by the personal representative from the legacies of children of the testator and issue of deceased children who take by representation. Each person shall contribute in the proportion which his legacy bears to all legacies of children of the testator and issue of deceased children taking by representation. Instead of contributing an interest in specific property to the pretermitted child, a legatee may pay the pretermitted child or his issue, in cash or other property acceptable to the pretermitted child or his issue, an amount equal to the fair market value of the interest in specific property as of the date of death of the testator.</text>
