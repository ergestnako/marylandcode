    <section prefix="(a)">If a tenant removes the tenant's goods from the leased premises, and the officer can find no goods of the tenant on the premises, the officer shall report that fact to the court. If the court is satisfied the goods of the tenant have been removed, it may issue an order to follow goods under distress within six months after filing of an action of distress. The order shall authorize levy on the removed goods at any place the goods can be found within the jurisdiction of the court.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">If the goods are removed outside the court's jurisdiction, the plaintiff may file with the court in the jurisdiction where the goods are located, a certified copy of the original action of distress, together with a verified petition setting forth (i) the fact of the original petition for distress, (ii) the premises to which the tenant has removed the goods, and (iii) the name and address of the occupant of the premises. If the occupant of the premises to which the goods are removed is a person other than the tenant, an order shall be served by first-class mail or by an officer on the other person giving the occupant seven days from the date of service of the order to protest seizure of the goods. If not protested, the order becomes final and authorizes any officer to seize and remove the goods.</section>
    <section prefix="(c)">Entry to premises under an order to follow goods under distress may be forcible.</section>
