  <text>The purposes of Part II of this subtitle are supplemental to the purposes for which State forests and units of the State park and wildlife refuge systems are established and administered. Nothing in Part II of this subtitle may interfere with either the purpose for which State forests are established or modify the statutory authority under which units of the State park system are created and continued. The designation of any area of any park, monument, or other unit of the State park system as wildlands may not lower the standards evolved for the use and preservation of the park, monument, or other unit of the State park system.</text>
