  <text>In Harford County no license shall be issued until the Board shall satisfy itself of the moral character and financial responsibility of the applicant, the appropriateness of the location where such licensed business is to be conducted, taking into consideration the number of such licenses already issued, any objections from owners of property living in the immediate neighborhood, and generally as to the applicant's fitness for the trust to be reposed. Each license shall designate the place of business of the licensee. The said Board shall determine what sales of foods, drinks or other commodities and items, in addition to the sale of foods cooked or prepared on the premises where the license is exercised, shall be permitted to be charged against the sale of beer and wine by the licensee as hereinafter prescribed, and a list of such items shall be from time to time printed by said Board and a copy thereof given to each licensee at the time the license is issued. In case a change is made in said list the Board shall immediately mail a copy of the revised list to each licensee. No license shall be granted to anyone who has been convicted in a federal or State court of a felony, or of the violation of the laws governing the manufacture or sale of liquor, or maintaining or operating a bawdyhouse, or a place where gambling has been permitted, or by the agent or representative of any such person.</text>
