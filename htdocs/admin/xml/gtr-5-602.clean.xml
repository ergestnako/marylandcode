  <text>An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of the users of an airport and of the occupants of land in its vicinity, and it also reduces, in effect, the area available for the landing, taking off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of an airport. It is, therefore, in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare that the political subdivisions of this State be authorized to adopt zoning regulations, as provided in this subtitle, and to acquire property, by purchase, grant, lease, or condemnation, in order to eliminate airport hazards.</text>
