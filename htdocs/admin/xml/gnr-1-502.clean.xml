  <text>The General Assembly finds and declares that the natural resources and the scenic beauty of the State of Maryland are in danger of irreparable harm occasioned by the use and exploitation of the physical environment. It further finds that improper use and exploitation constitute an invasion of the right of every resident of Maryland to an environment free from pollution to the extent possible. It further finds that the courts of the State of Maryland are an appropriate forum for seeking the protection of the environment and that an unreasonably strict procedural definition of "standing to sue" in environmental matters is not in the public interest.</text>
