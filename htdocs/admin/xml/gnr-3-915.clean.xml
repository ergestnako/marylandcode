  <text>The bonds shall not be deemed to constitute a debt, liability or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State of Maryland or of any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor. All such bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the State of Maryland nor any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority shall be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues pledged thereto and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. The issuance of bonds under the provisions of this subtitle is not directly or indirectly or contingently an obligation, moral or other, of the State of Maryland or any political subdivision thereof to levy or pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the Authority from pledging its full faith and credit to the payment of bonds authorized pursuant to this subtitle. However, this section does not limit the ability of the State or a subdivision to set, impose, or collect an assessment, rate, fee, or charge to pay to the Authority the cost of a project, including the principal of and interest on a bond or note, under an agreement between the Authority and the State or subdivision.</text>
