    <section prefix="(a)">A Natural Resources police officer or any law enforcement officer, upon arresting any person for violating any provision of this title or any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to it, may seize every device, equipment, conveyance, or property unlawfully used. If the owner or person in charge of the seized device, equipment, conveyance, or property is convicted, the court may declare the device, equipment, conveyance, or property forfeited in addition to any other penalty provided in this title. Any forfeiture becomes the property of the Department for disposition at its discretion. If the owner is not known, the court may proceed ex parte to hear and determine any question of forfeiture. If the owner or person charged with the violation is not convicted, the device, equipment, conveyance, or property seized shall be released and returned to the owner or person charged.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">However, the device, equipment, conveyance, or property may not be forfeited if the owner was not a consenting party or privy to a violation.</section>
