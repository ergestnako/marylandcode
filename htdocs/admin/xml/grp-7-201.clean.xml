  <text>If any property is granted, and the purchase money, or any part of it, remains unpaid at the time of the grant, the vendor may not have a lien or charge on the property for any other sum of money than the sum that appears to be due on the face of the deed. The time set for payment shall be specified and recited in the deed. No provision in this section may be construed to affect any mortgage or deed of trust given by a purchaser to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase money, or in any way affect or postpone the lien of any landlord on goods or chattels for the satisfaction or security of rent due or accruing.</text>
