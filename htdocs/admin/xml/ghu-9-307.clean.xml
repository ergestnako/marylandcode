Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the "Model State Administrative Procedures Act," 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the Interstate Commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the U.S. Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the Commission.</section>

If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence, (as defined in the Model State Administrative Procedures Act) in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside.</section>
    <section prefix="(e)">If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</section>
