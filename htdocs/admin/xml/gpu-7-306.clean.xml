          <section prefix="1.">The dollar value of net excess generation shall be equal to the generation or commodity portion of the rate that the eligible customer-generator would have been charged by the electric company averaged over the previous 12-month period ending with the billing cycle that is complete immediately prior to the end of April multiplied by the number of kilowatt-hours of net excess generation.</section>
          <section prefix="2.">For customers served by an electricity supplier, the dollar value of the net excess generation shall be equal to the generation or commodity rate that the customer would have been charged by the electricity supplier multiplied by the number of kilowatt-hours of net excess generation.</section>
