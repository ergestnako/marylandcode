  <text>In all cases where the channels established under this subtitle cross railroad rights-of-way at the intersection of the right-of-way with a natural watercourse or depression through which water flows at periods of high water, the railroad company shall be required to construct, build and maintain any necessary new bridges or culverts, or to enlarge, strengthen, reconstruct, or replace any old ones. In all cases where the channels intersect such rights-of-way, the expense of building such bridges or culverts shall be considered by the viewers as an element of damage to the railroad company and shall be shown as such in their report.</text>
