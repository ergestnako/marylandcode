  <text>If the reversion of any leased premises merges in any other estate, the person entitled to the estate into which the reversion merges has the same remedy against the tenant for nonpayment of rent or other forfeiture, or for not performing conditions, covenants, or agreements, as the person entitled to the reversion would have had if the reversion had not merged.</text>
