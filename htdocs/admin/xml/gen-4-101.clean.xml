  <text>The General Assembly determines and finds that lands and waters comprising the watersheds of the State are great natural assets and resources. As a result of erosion and sediment deposit on lands and in waters within the watersheds of the State, these waters are being polluted and despoiled to such a degree that fish, marine life, and recreational use of the waters are being affected adversely. To protect the natural resources of the State, the Secretary of the Environment, in consultation with the Secretary of Natural Resources shall adopt criteria and procedures for the counties and the local soil conservation districts to implement soil erosion control programs. These procedures may provide for departmental review and approval of major grading, sediment, and erosion control plans. These procedures shall provide that the Department of the Environment conduct periodic inspections and review of the implementation by the counties and the local soil conservation districts of these control plans.</text>
