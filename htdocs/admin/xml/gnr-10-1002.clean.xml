  <text>In order to aid the relief of crop depredations and to provide further protection to wild waterfowl, any person or group of persons, individually or collectively, may apply to the Department for a license to feed waterfowl upon land owned or operated by the person or group or in waters within 300 yards of a shoreline owned or operated by the person or group in accordance with the following policies and guidelines and the regulations and procedures the Secretary adopts under the authority granted. It is the purpose of this subtitle to encourage the placement of feed to supplement the dwindling supply of natural feed available to wild waterfowl in the State and to regulate feeding so that it is not a means of attracting wild waterfowl to, on, or over the area where the hunters are attempting to take the waterfowl.</text>
