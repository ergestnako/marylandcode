  <text>The board of county commissioners shall consider this report at their first meeting, at which the engineer and the other two viewers shall be present. If the viewers report that the drainage is not practicable or that it will not benefit the public health, or any public highway, or be conducive to the general welfare of the community, and the board of county commissioners shall approve such finding, the petition shall be dismissed at the cost of the petitioners. If the report of the viewers is favorable to the project and the board of county commissioners shall so find after hearing all the evidence, they shall make such recommendations as they think proper to the viewers, and direct them to make a complete survey, plans and specifications, and estimate of cost for the tiles, drains or levees, or other improvements, and fix a time when said engineer and viewers shall complete and file their final reports, not exceeding sixty days, unless extended by the commissioners in writing.</text>
