    <section prefix="(a)">A person who is the owner or operator of any gas well may not willfully take gas from the well unless the gas is metered by a standard metering system. The cleaning or blowing of a well is not construed as a "taking" within the meaning of this section. If any person or operator producing gas from any well violates the terms of this section, the person's or operator's interest in the lease under which the well is being produced shall be void and subject to cancellation at the suit of the owners of the royalty interest in the leased premises on which the violation occurs.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">The Department shall inspect, read, or test any meters, through which natural gas is being measured upon the request of any lessor, lessee, operator, or royalty owner from whose land, lease, or royalty interest, natural gas is being produced.</section>
