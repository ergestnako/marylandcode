  <text>The jurisdiction of every county bounded at any point by navigable waters shall extend from the shore to the inside of the channel, which shall be regarded to be the center of said waters, except where said waters adjoin neighboring states, in which case the jurisdiction of said counties shall continue to the ultimate limits of the State at the place in question; provided, however, that nothing in this section or &#xA7;&#xA7; 83 and 84 shall be construed as changing such rights as the State of Maryland may have on or under such waters.</text>
