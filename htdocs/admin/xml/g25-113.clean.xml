  <text>At the date set for hearing any landowner may appear in person or by counsel and file his objection in writing to the report of the viewers; and it shall be the duty of the board to carefully review the report of the viewers and the objections filed thereto, and make such changes as are necessary to render substantial and equal justice to all the landowners in the district. If, in the opinion of the board, the cost of construction, together with the amount of damages assessed, is not greater than the benefits that will accrue to the land affected, the board shall confirm the report of the viewers, and declare the drainage district as established. If, however, the board finds that the cost of construction, together with the damages assessed, is greater than the resulting benefit that will accrue to the lands affected, the board shall dismiss the proceedings at the cost of the petitioners, and the sureties upon the bond so filed by them shall be liable for such costs.</text>
