  <text>The party states find that:<section prefix="(a)">In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately ten billion dollars from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.</section><section prefix="(b)">Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.</section><section prefix="(c)">The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another to complement each other's activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.</section><section prefix="(d)">While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.</section></text>
