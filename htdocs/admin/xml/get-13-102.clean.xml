  <text>The purposes of this title are to simplify the administration of the estates of minors and disabled persons, to reduce the expenses of administration, to clarify the law governing the estates of minors and disabled persons, and to eliminate certain provisions of existing law which are archaic, often meaningless under modern procedures, and no longer useful. This article shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes.</text>
