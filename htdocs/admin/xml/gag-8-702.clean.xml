    <section prefix="(a)">The General Assembly finds and declares that agriculturally related nonpoint sources of water pollution may potentially contribute to the degradation of the water resources of this State and that prevention and control efforts have been hampered because of the cost and lack of income producing potential in many agricultural practices designed to protect water quality. To assist in the implementation of agricultural practices which minimize water pollution from erosion, animal wastes, nutrients, and agricultural chemicals, a cost sharing program between the State and eligible applicants is established for the public benefit.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">The cost sharing program established under this subtitle shall be implemented in conjunction with the "Agricultural Water Quality Management Program for the Control of Sediment and Animal Wastes" of the State Soil Conservation Committee as well as other State and local programs to control water pollution.</section>
