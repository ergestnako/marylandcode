    <section prefix="(a)">If the Department is satisfied that a limited liability partnership named in the proclamation has not failed to pay the tax, unemployment insurance contributions, or reimbursement payments, or file the report under &#xA7; 9A-1007 of this subtitle, or that it has been mistakenly reported to the Department by the State Comptroller or the Secretary of the Department of Business and Economic Development, the Department may correct the mistake by filing its proclamation to that effect in its records.</section>
    <section prefix="(b)">The effect of a proclamation correcting a mistake is to restore the right to do business as a limited liability partnership in Maryland and the right to the use of the name of the limited liability partnership as if the right to do business as a limited liability partnership in Maryland and the right to the use of the name had at all times remained in full force and effect.</section>
