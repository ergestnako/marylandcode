    <section prefix="(b)">Upon termination of the existence of the Medical System Corporation, all its rights and properties shall pass to and be vested in the State, but subject in all cases to any mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances or any other rights or interests of creditors of the Medical System Corporation or other third parties.</section>
